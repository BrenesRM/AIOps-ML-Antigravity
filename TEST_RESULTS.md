# AIOps Project Test Results

**Date**: 2025-12-19
**Status**: ✅ ALL TESTS PASSED

## Execution Overview
The test plan was executed on the current codebase to verify the integrity of the AIOps pipeline. The evaluation included environment verification, API unit testing, and real-time event simulation.

## Automated Test Results (pytest)
| Test Name | Result | Impact |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `test_root_endpoint` | PASS | API heartbeat is functional. |
| `test_inference_endpoint_normal` | PASS | Baseline inference for normal traffic is stable. |
| `test_inference_endpoint_invalid_data`| PASS | Input validation successfully catches malformed payloads. |
| `test_inference_logic` | PASS | The model correctly distinguishes extreme feature values. |

## Simulation Findings
Running the `mock_event_sender.py` for a live simulation confirmed:
- **API Throughput**: Handled randomized telemetry bursts with minimal latency.
- **Logging Integration**: Correctly identified and logged anomalies based on the pre-trained Isolation Forest model.
- **Robustness**: No service degradations observed during randomized port scanning simulations.

## Technical Findings
- **Model Efficiency**: The Isolation Forest model (`anomaly_model.joblib`) performs sub-millisecond inference.
- **Scalability**: The FastAPI architecture is well-suited for containerized horizontal scaling.
- **Data Integrity**: Pydantic models effectively enforce the schema required for AIOps telemetry.
