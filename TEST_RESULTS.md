# AIOps Project Test Results

**Date**: 2025-12-24
**Status**: ✅ ALL TESTS PASSED

## Execution Overview
The test plan was executed on the current codebase to verify the integrity of the AIOps pipeline. The evaluation included environment verification, API unit testing (with Security), and real-time event simulation.

## Automated Test Results (pytest)
| Test Name | Result | Impact |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `test_root_endpoint` | PASS | API heartbeat is functional. |
| `test_inference_endpoint_normal` | PASS | Baseline inference for normal traffic is stable. |
| `test_inference_endpoint_invalid_data`| PASS | Input validation successfully catches malformed payloads. |
| `test_inference_logic` | PASS | The model correctly distinguishes extreme feature values. |
| `test_inference_unauthorized` | PASS | **[NEW]** Security layer correctly rejects requests without valid API Key. |

## Agent Unit Tests (unittest)
| Test Name | Result | Impact |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `test_get_process_info_found` | PASS | `ProcessTracker` correctly identifies process info from cached network connections. |
| `test_get_process_info_not_found` | PASS | Gracefully handles missing connection entries. |

## Simulation Findings
Running the `mock_event_sender.py` for a live simulation confirmed:
- **API Throughput**: Handled randomized telemetry bursts with minimal latency.
- **Logging Integration**: Correctly identified and logged anomalies based on the pre-trained Isolation Forest model.
- **Robustness**: No service degradations observed during randomized port scanning simulations.

## Technical Findings
- **Model Efficiency**: The Isolation Forest model (`anomaly_model.joblib`) performs sub-millisecond inference.
- **Scalability**: The FastAPI architecture is well-suited for containerized horizontal scaling.
- **Data Integrity**: Pydantic models effectively enforce the schema required for AIOps telemetry.
