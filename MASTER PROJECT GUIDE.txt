You are an AIOps, Machine Learning Infrastructure, Python, Windows, Security, and System Administration expert.

I already have a CSV file named:
network_traffic_data.csv

Schema (already available, do NOT invent columns):
timestamp,
process_path,
process_hash,
source_ip,
dest_ip,
dest_domain,
dest_port,
bytes_sent,
bytes_recv,
protocol,
dns_query,
parent_process,
user_context

Your task is to design and implement an AIOps-ready machine learning project in CLEAR PHASES.
You MUST complete and validate each phase before proceeding to the next.
DO NOT jump ahead.

====================================
GENERAL RULES
====================================
- Use production-grade Python code
- Prefer sklearn / pandas / numpy for ML
- Use FastAPI for REST API
- Model must be serializable (joblib or pickle)
- Everything must be runnable on:
  - Google Colab (training)
  - Local machine (Docker Desktop)
- Security-aware defaults (input validation, logging)
- Explain WHY decisions are made
- Provide folder structure
- No placeholders like "TODO"
- Stop and wait for confirmation between phases

====================================
PHASE 1 — DATA, TRAINING & MODEL EXPORT
====================================
Objective:
Train an ML model using network_traffic_data.csv for anomaly detection or behavioral change detection suitable for AIOps.

Tasks:
1. Connect to Google Colab
2. Load network_traffic_data.csv
3. Perform:
   - Data cleaning
   - Feature engineering (categorical encoding, timestamps, ports, bytes)
   - Explain feature selection
4. Train an ML model suitable for AIOps:
   - Unsupervised or semi-supervised preferred
   - Justify algorithm choice
5. Evaluate model
6. Save model to disk
7. Download model to local machine

Deliverables:
- Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)
- Saved model file
- Clear instructions to download artifacts

STOP AFTER PHASE 1.
WAIT until I confirm everything works correctly.

====================================
PHASE 2 — REST API FOR REAL-TIME EVENTS
====================================
Objective:
Expose the trained model via a REST API for real-time inference and alert dispatch.

Tasks:
1. Create a FastAPI application
2. Load the trained model
3. Expose endpoint:
   POST /event
4. Validate incoming payload matches CSV schema
5. Run inference
6. Trigger alerts when behavioral change/anomaly detected
7. Log events and alerts

Deliverables:
- app.py
- requirements.txt
- Example curl request
- Explanation of alert logic

STOP AFTER PHASE 2.
WAIT for confirmation.

====================================
PHASE 3 — EVENT GENERATOR (MOCK AIOps AGENT)
====================================
Objective:
Simulate a network telemetry agent sending events to the REST API.

Tasks:
1. Create a Python script that:
   - Reads rows from network_traffic_data.csv
   - Randomizes values slightly
   - Sends events to the REST API
2. Show expected responses
3. Designed as an AIOps event producer

Deliverables:
- mock_event_sender.py
- Execution instructions

STOP AFTER PHASE 3.
WAIT for confirmation.

====================================
PHASE 4 — DOCKERIZATION & LOCAL DEPLOYMENT
====================================
Objective:
Run everything locally using Docker Desktop.

Tasks:
1. Create Dockerfile
2. Create docker-compose.yml (if needed)
3. Mount model and app locally
4. Expose REST API
5. Ensure reproducible build

Deliverables:
- Dockerfile
- docker-compose.yml
- Run commands
- Folder structure

====================================
FINAL OUTPUT FORMAT
====================================
- Clear phase-by-phase execution
- Code blocks only where needed
- Architecture explanation
- Security considerations
- AIOps relevance

Begin with **PHASE 1 ONLY**.
